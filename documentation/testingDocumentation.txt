Cardboard:
Tester 1: 
How is your feeling in the dungeon? i feel comfortable but it is bit dark in here
What is about the hight? well, since castles have big doors, it is okay to me.
What kind of mood describe this scene best? its a entry hall for a romantic castle dinner but obviously the hall is in the middle of nowhere.
think about a mystic scene, do you still think it is too dark? no.

Tester 2:
How is your feeling in the dungeon? for a castle it is bit too small. When it should be a entry hall, then the doors are too small. a room as a part of a wall it is a useless room with 2 doors.
What is about the hight? the hight is okay, when i see it as a usual room.
what kind of mood describes this scene best? it is a useless room for a castle, a strange place for a room in the nowhere. cause i cant see any background.
think about a mystic scene, do you still think it is a useless room? well i never was in a mystic room so i cant say yes or no....
